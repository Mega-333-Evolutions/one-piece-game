    Sanitizes a name for use on a wanted poster, for scripts that aren't shown as-is (see
    NATIVE_SCRIPT_FONT_MAP / get_native_script).

    The poster font only supports latin characters, so names are normally transliterated
    with unidecode. The problem is that unidecode doesn't just transliterate, it also
    *describes* characters it has no real letter equivalent for (e.g. the chess piece "♚"
    becomes the phrase "black king", an emoji becomes a description, etc.). Those
    descriptions would otherwise be added to the name, making it longer than it should be
    and, in the worst case, pushing it past the point where it gets discarded entirely,
    resulting in a blank name on the poster.

    To support as many characters as possible while avoiding that, every character is
    transliterated individually and only kept if the result is a clean word with no
    spaces in it (e.g. "Ⓐ" -> "A", "Ω" -> "O", "你" -> "Ni", "Ⅷ" -> "VIII" are all kept).
    Characters whose transliteration is a description made up of multiple words (e.g.
    "♚" -> "black king") or that have no latin equivalent at all (most emoji) are
    discarded instead of being spelled out.

    Known "fancy font" look-alike characters (see FANCY_FONT_LOOKALIKE_CHAR_MAP) are mapped
    to their intended Latin letter directly, bypassing unidecode, since unidecode would
    otherwise transliterate them based on their unrelated real meaning instead of their
    intended visual appearance. Any other non-ASCII look-alike not in that map is checked
